# Ilyass' Super Amazing Tic-Tac-Toe game

## Project description
A basic Tic-Tac-Toe Game created with JavaFX for my Object Oriented Programming with Java 2 @ Champlain College.
In those files, you will see a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game that sees the rules of a classic game that you could play on paper or even on the window of a car. It was programmed
using the IntelliJ Idea IDE as well as the JavaFX library. No particular algorithm was followed for the creation of the project.

## Design
The project is designed with 4 classes including the main method. It contains the TileBoard class, which has all of the logic behind it, as well as helper
methods to help the project run smoothly. The InfoCenter class is used for everything centered around styling and the overall structure of the application.
There is also a small Constants class that holds the constants for delimiting the application's borders and everything like that.

I do feel like the project is incomplete and rushed, and would've hoped to develop it a little more. It would be great to be able to run it as a desktop app, and 
would be interesting to understand how the process behind it works. It would've also been pretty interesting and better to use an algorithm know as the Minimax algorithm

One challenge I faced was definitely more on the object oriented side. It was very hard at times to figure out how to add things on the application through code.
